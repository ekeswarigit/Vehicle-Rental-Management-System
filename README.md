# Abstract

The Vehicle Rental Management System is designed to simplify the process of renting vehicles by automating customer registration, vehicle management, and booking operations.
Using Hibernate ORM, the system efficiently interacts with a MySQL database, enabling secure, flexible, and scalable data handling.
This project removes the need for manual processes and provides a seamless backend workflow. The application runs purely on console-based Java, 
offering CRUD operations with clear navigation menus. This system is beneficial for small rental agencies seeking automation.
